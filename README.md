# Motion signature of individuals

The goal of this project is to replicate the experiments conducted by Maty Bohacek in his paper [Protecting President Zelenskyi against deepfakes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12043).

## Usage

### With extracted data (== using the data given by the author)
- Run Jupyter running `jupyter-notebook` and choosing `main.ipynb` in Jupyter's interface

### With no extracted data

- Collect the dataset *[TODO]*, follow the sturucture and the naming precisely.
- Install all the required applications using `bash install.sh`
- Run the extraction process by `python extract.py`

All the potentional questions and suggestions can be addressed via Issues.<br>
